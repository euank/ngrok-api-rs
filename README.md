## ngrok-api-rs

### Status

#### Unstable

This library is currently unstable and actively being iterated on.

You're quite welcome to try it out, but breaking changes may happen without
notice.

### Description

This library provides types and methods for interacting with the [ngrok HTTP api](https://ngrok.com/docs/api).

It is an [async library](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/), and will
thus require using some form of async runtime.

See the [examples](./examples) for examples of its usage!

### Versioning

This library uses semver. Currently, it is <1.0.0, and so no strict
compatibility promises are made.
