## WIP - ngrok-api-rs

This is a work-in-progress api client library for rust.

The goal of this is to hand-write a minimal client for a small number of ngrok
types, and then use that as a model to generate the entire thing.

### Status

The included examples run and are representative of what is or isn't implemented yet.

Not much is implemented.
